# blog-site(no longer viewable as was hosted on university's server)

A blog site where global users(not logged in) can view posted articles, or create an account as a publisher or an author to write, edit, and publish articles. This project was completed for extra credit in my Web Programming 
in Java class on Fall 2022. In this project, I implemented the MVC layout -utilizing java servlets, JSTL, JSP, JDBC, MySQL, and vanilla Java. For the front end, I used Bootstrap.
